### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Become more familiar with styling concepts using css. Solidify knowledge of html layout and proper html tags to use.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
One of the biggest wins for me was learning how to use grid with css. I was also able to brush up on my skills using new icons to align inside of my navbar. I would like to add more design elements and functionality in the future. One item I would like to add to each card would be a link that brings you to a new page showing various mountain biking trails in that location specified by the card.
